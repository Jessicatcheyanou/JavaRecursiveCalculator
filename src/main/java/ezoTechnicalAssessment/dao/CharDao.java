 * This interface defines the methods that must be implemented
 * by any class that wants to play the role of DAO in the application.
 * We will implement a text file-based DAO in the code-along.
 * You could imagine, however, an implementation that only stored
 * student data in memory or one that stored student data in a database.
 * Each class would be different but all would implement that same interface,
 * ensuring that they are all well encapsulated.
 * Note that the CharController only uses this interface to
 * reference the DAO â€” it is completely unaware of the implementation details
